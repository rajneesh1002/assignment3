    <h1 align="center"><u>TYPES OF SENTENCES IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</u></h1>

    <h1> 1. DECLARATIVE SENTENCES </h1>

    <p class="ad">A declarative sentence is used to provide information about something or make statements and almost
        always
        ends in a period. It’s the most basic sentence type that you can use, and can be as simple or complex as
        necessary to get the point across. You will likely rely on declarative sentences for the majority of your
        academic writing as they are used to communicate facts, statements, and evidence.</p>

    <h1> 2. IMPERATIVE SENTENCES </h1>

    <p class="sd"> An imperative sentence is used to make a command, and ends in either a period or an exclamation mark.
        Essentially, instead of conveying information, an imperative sentence tells someone to do something. It
        doesn’t always have to be a strong command. Sometimes it can be used to give someone advice, instruct
        someone on how to do something, or simply address someone. Most of the time, these types of sentences are
        used in casual conversation or dialogue within fictional or creative writing. You generally won’t use them
        in academic writing unless you’re quoting dialogue. </p>

    <h1> 3. INTERROGATIVE SENTENCES </h1>

    <p class="ad sd"> Interrogative sentences ask questions, and are usually directly spoken or written to the subject.
        They
        always end in a question mark. Often, interrogative sentences begin with who, what, where, when, why, how,
        or do. Like imperative sentences, they don’t always need to include a subject because they are directly
        spoken to someone, and for this reason they are not always presented as complete sentences. </p>

    <h1>4. EXCLAMATORY SENTENCES</h1>
    
    <p>An exclamatory sentence is used to convey a strong emotion and most often ends with an exclamation mark. Just
        like a declarative sentence, an exclamatory sentence makes a statement about something, but with a stronger
        impression.</p>
